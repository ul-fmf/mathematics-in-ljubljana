# Program

Our summer school is a five-day program (Monday to Friday, Sunday and Saturday are arrival and departure days) packed with stimulating mathematical content and enriching cultural experiences.

<span class="minicourse">
Our mornings will be dedicated to two minicourses:
</span>

- Bla≈æ Jelenc: *Differential geometric design of mechanisms*
- Jose Antonio Montero Aguilar: *Are your polyhedra the same as my polyhedra?*

<span class="researchgroup">
In the afternoons, attendees will have the opportunity to learn about the exciting research conducted by various local research groups, covering the following areas:
</span>

- Algebra and Functional Analysis
- Complex Analysis
- Discrete Mathematics
- Foundations of Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science
- Geometry
- Numerical Analysis
- Probability, Statistics and Financial Mathematics
- Topology

<span class="info">
Alongside mathematical content, we'll provide valuable insights into master's and doctoral programs, including the chance to pursue a double degree with the University of Trieste for master's students. Additionally, we'll offer information on arrival, accommodation, and studying in Ljubljana, along with perspectives from current foreign master's and doctoral students on life and academics in the city.
</span>

Throughout the week, we'll organize engaging cultural activities, starting with a guided tour of Ljubljana on the first day and an excursion to Bled on Wednesday. Participants can explore the memorial room of Josip Plemelj, the first rector of the University of Ljubljana and a renowned mathematician, to discover more about his life and contributions.

# Mathematics in Ljubljana 2025

Join us for a week of exciting mathematics at the summer school Mathematics in Ljubljana 2025, taking place **from June 30th to July 4th, 2025 in Ljubljana, Slovenia**. Our goal is to introduce curious students to the most fascinating areas of mathematics studied in Ljubljana.

In addition to an overview of the local research groups, we will offer three minicourses to delve deeper into specific topics, as well as plenty of social activities to help you make connections with fellow participants.

Our summer school is designed for motivated bachelor's and master's students of mathematics who are interested in pursuing master's or PhD studies at University of Ljubljana, visiting our University as a part of Erasmus exchange, or furthering their academic career in mathematics. However, we welcome applications from students outside of this scope who can demonstrate reasonable motivation for attending.

The summer school will be held entirely in English. There's no registration fee and we are providing free housing, breakfast and lunch for participants.
